What if I was made for you
And you were made for me
What if this is it
What if it's meant to be
What if I ain't one of them
Fools just Playin' some game
What if I just pulled you close
What if I leaned in
And the stars line up
And it's our last first kiss
What if one of these days baby
I'd go and change your name
What if I loved all these what ifs away
